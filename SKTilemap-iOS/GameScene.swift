            way to do things when using Tiled as you get a visual represtantion. This layer is usually set to "hidden"

            The property can be called anything you want and does not need a value. 
            When initializing a graph this way you can provide the names of the layers you wish to check for tiles with
            that property. The parameter is not required though and if left out all layers will be checked. Any tile found
